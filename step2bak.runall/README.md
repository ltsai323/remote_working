Use working point estimates number of C / B / L in psuedo data
psuedo data : GJetMadgraph
efficiency : GJetPythiaFlat
Calculate efficiency and calculate number of L / C / B in psuedo data and use truth data to validate it
without fit. The psuedo data removed di-jet event. So use cut and count to evaluate
